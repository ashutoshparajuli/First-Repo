## First-Repo
### My First Repository in a GitHub.
#### This is an edited version of the sample repository created under branch readme-edit. 
Branch is created to make and commit changes in a repository without altering the original file. After making and committing necessary changes in a branch one can send a pull request to merge the branch with a master. Braching helps large group of people working together in a project to work independently and seperately while still being able to contribute to the original project.
